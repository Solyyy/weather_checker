# Weather Checker

# About

This project  will check if it is going to rain in the next 12 hours using your current location's latitude and longitude, if so it will email you to bring an umbrella with you.
This project uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
Use [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net/) to find your city's latitude and longitude.
I am running my code in the cloud, so it is always running in the background.
